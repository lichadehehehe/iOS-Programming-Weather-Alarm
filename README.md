1. The free api provided by OPENWEATHERMAP.com sometimes will be throttled. If failed to fetch the weather data by error code 429, it means it's the api provider's issue.


2. The alarm notification, while the app is running in the foreground, will be played for 5 seconds; while the app is running in the background, will be played for 30 seconds (maximum notification alarm time allowed by ios).

3. The alarm sound will be changed according to weather.

4. The "Push notification to user during bad weather" function can not be implemented because none of us have a developer account.
